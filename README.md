# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at [danielsu.ca](http://danielsu.ca).

## Technologies

This project is built with vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

It's a lightweight, static website with no backend.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main entry point for the website.
- `app.css`: CSS stylesheet for the index.html page.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file to handle animations and responsive UI.
- `img/`: Directory for all the images used in the website.

## Running locally

You can run this project locally by simply cloning the repository and opening `index.html` in your browser. Here's how you do it step-by-step:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/daniel-su1/site.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

3. Open `index.html` with your preferred web browser:
